## Self-Balance-Bot-master(雙輪平衡車)
  
### Introduction
This projects purpose was to design and build a two wheeled upright robot.A two-wheeled
differential drive mobile robot based on the inverted pendulum model is built as a platform
to investigate the use of a Kalman filter to estimate the tilt angle. As the robot is
mechanically unstable, it becomes necessary to explore the possibilities of
implementing a control system to keep the system in equilibrium.

  This project examines the suitability and evaluates the performance of a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR) and a Pole-placement controller in balancing the system. The LQR controller
uses several weighting matrix to obtain the appropriate control force to be applied to the
system while the Pole placement requires the poles of the system to be placed to guarantee
stability. As the robot will be moving about on a surface, a PID controller is implemented to
control the trajectory of the robot.
